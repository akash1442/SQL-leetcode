You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score.
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

CODE:

SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(s.max_score) AS total_score
FROM Hackers h
JOIN (
    SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS max_score
    FROM Submissions
    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id
) s ON h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, h.hacker_id ASC;
